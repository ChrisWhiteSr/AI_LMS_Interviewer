# Gemini's Proposed Architecture: AI Learning Module (Version 1 - Text-Only)

This document outlines a simple, functional architecture for an AI-powered learning module. The primary goal is to assess a user's current understanding of AI to ultimately develop a curriculum for "vibe coding." This version is a text-only MVP designed for multiple users and includes an administrator view. It can be deployed easily on Vercel with a minimal toolset.

## Core Principles

*   **Simplicity:** The system is designed for ease of use, with no formal login process.
*   **AI-Driven:** The core learning experience (question generation, analysis, and summarization) is driven by an LLM.
*   **Vercel-Native:** Leverage Vercel's platform for a seamless development and deployment experience.
*   **Asynchronous Analysis:** Process user answers asynchronously to provide a responsive user experience.

| **Framework**            | [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router) | A full-stack React framework that handles both frontend and backend, perfect for Vercel.                 |
| **Styling**              | [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)         | A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.                                               |
| **Database**             | [Supabase Postgres](https://supabase.com) | A hosted Postgres with batteries: SQL, RLS, and a great JS client. Stores session JSON in a `sessions` table. |
| **AI Question & Analysis** | [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)      | For dynamically generating questions, analyzing answers, and creating end-of-session summaries.       |
| **Deployment**           | [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)                    | The all-in-one platform for deploying the entire application.                                         |

## Architecture Overview

The system is a monolithic Next.js application where the backend logic is handled by API Routes, which Vercel deploys as serverless functions. Session data is persisted in Supabase (Postgres).

**User Identification:**
To keep the experience simple, there is no formal authentication. Users are asked to provide a name, but can also proceed anonymously. A unique session ID is generated for each assessment to group the data. Each session's data is stored as a single row in Supabase `public.sessions` with JSONB columns for `questions`, `answers`, and `summary`.

### User Workflow

1.  **Start Screen:** The user is presented with the disclaimer: “This interview is designed to capture your opinions on current topics—there are no right or wrong answers.” They are then prompted to enter their name or continue anonymously.
2.  **Session Start:** A new learning session begins.
3.  **Dynamic Question & Answer Cycle:**
    *   The backend calls the Gemini API to generate a question relevant to "vibe coding."
    *   The user submits their text answer.
    *   The question and answer are appended to JSON arrays in the `public.sessions` row and saved via Supabase.
    *   An asynchronous process provides the user with immediate feedback on their answer, also generated by Gemini.

4.  **End-of-Session Summary Generation (Asynchronous):**
    *   Once a user completes a session, a final API Route is triggered.
    *   This function retrieves the session row from Supabase.
    *   It sends the entire conversation to the Gemini API with a specific prompt instructing it to:
        1.  Infer the user's preferred learning style (e.g., practical, theoretical, visual).
        2.  Generate a personalized, ordered 5-day course outline for teaching "vibe-coding."
    *   The resulting summary is added to the `summary` JSONB column and saved via Supabase.

### Administrator Workflow

1.  **Dashboard Access:** The administrator accesses a protected route (e.g., `/admin`).
2.  **Review User Sessions & Summaries:** The admin dashboard queries Supabase for all sessions and displays a list of completed sessions. The admin can select any session to view the user's name (if provided), the full question and answer history, and the final AI-generated summary with the learning style and 5-day course outline.

## Strengths of this Architecture

*   **Actionable Insights:** The admin-facing summary provides a clear, actionable plan for how to proceed with a user's education.
*   **Low Friction:** No required login makes it easy for users to start an assessment.
*   **Highly Dynamic Content:** Questions and summaries are generated by the AI for a unique assessment every time.
*   **Cost-Effective & Scalable:** The serverless architecture is cheap to start with and scales automatically.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

*   **Subjective Analysis:** The LLM's ability to accurately infer a learning style and create an effective curriculum from text answers is highly subjective and a key dependency.
*   **No User History:** Without accounts, users cannot view their past session history. This could be added later with formal authentication.
*   **Basic Admin Dashboard:** The V1 admin view is for data review. Supabase enables SQL querying, so filtering/pagination can be implemented efficiently server-side later.
